## Progress Towards Goals
### Restatement of minimal requirements
1. Vote history information is loaded into database
2. **Profile page for each councillor, with contact data**
3. **Councillor profile page has their recent voting history**
4. Vote history page by date, with all councillor votes

    We made progress towards goals 2 & 3 for this week's requirements. The profile page for a councillor is a work in progress. The dark mode mobile page was first developed AdobeXD and the basic react/meteor structure has been established. A good amount of the styling was built, with refinements to come.
